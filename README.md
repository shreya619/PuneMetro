# PuneMetro
•	Developed a comprehensive C++ application to calculate the shortest path between metro stations in Pune, integrating Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal route determination by Implementing a dynamic graph structure with edge weights representing distances between stations, allowing for efficient pathfinding and distance calculations.
•	Created a feature to compute total travel distance and integrated fare calculation logic based on distance and user possession of an NCMC card
•	Designed functionality to handle two distinct metro corridors, calculating necessary switches between corridors, enhancing route planning accuracy.
